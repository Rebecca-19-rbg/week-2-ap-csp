print("You’ll review variables, strings, numbers, and print formatting.\n")

# Step 1: Create Variables
# TODO: Replace the values below with your own info
first_name = "Rebecca"
age = 16
favorite_color = "Green"
favorite_number = 19

#  Step 2: Practice String Operations
# 1. Print your name in uppercase
print("Uppercase:", first_name.upper())

# 2. Print how many letters are in your name
print("Length of name:", len(first_name))

# 3. Combine your name and favorite color into one message
print(f"Hello my name is" {first_name}, "and my favorite color is" (favorite_color))

#  Step 3: Math Practice
# Use arithmetic operators with your favorite number
print("Subtraction (20 - 1):", (favorite_number))

#  Step 4: User Input Practice
# Ask the user two questions and combine answers

input("What's your name?")
print("Hello,", input)
input


# ⚙️ Step 5: Final Challenge (combine it all)
# Use math and strings together
