# Step 1: Create Variables
# TODO: Replace the values below with your own info
first_name = "Rebecca"
age = 16
favorite_color = "Green"
favorite_number = 19

#  Step 2: Practice String Operations
# 1. Print your name in uppercase
print("Uppercase:", first_name.upper())

# 2. Print how many letters are in your name
print("Length of name:", len(first_name))

# 3. Combine your name and favorite color into one message
print(f"{first_name}, and {favorite_color}")

#  Step 3: Math Practice
# Use arithmetic operators with your favorite number
print("Subtraction (20 - 1)=", (favorite_number))

#  Step 4: User Input Practice
# Ask the user two questions and combine answers

user_name = input("What is your name?")
print("Your name is", (user_name))

user_color = input("What's your favorite color?")
print("Your favorite color is", (user_color))

print("Your name is", (user_name) "and your favorite color is", (user_color))

# ⚙️ Step 5: Final Challenge (combine it all)
# Use math and strings together
